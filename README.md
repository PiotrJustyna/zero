# What is zero?

Zero is a silly little realtime rendering/game project I'm working on in my spare time. It is an exercise in using:

* Haskell
* OpenGL (GPipe to be more specific)
* QuickCheck
* Travis

in a sort-of-real-life project. I have always enjoyed playing with real-time rendering and Haskell, so one day this silly little idea dawned on me: why not combine both of them and actually write something that lives and breathes? Zero is just that - let's see what it evolves into :smile:
